    <h1>The Key</h1>
    <p>
      You manage to catch the key mid-air. As soon as you touch it, you feel a strange tingling sensation running through your hand. The key begins to glow, and a door materializes in front of you. It seems like the key is meant to unlock this door. Will you use the key to open the door or keep it for later?
