      The March Hare, the Dormouse, and the Mad Hatter eagerly invite you to join them in their tea-drinking extravaganza. The Hatter's nonsensical riddles and the Hare's constant time-checking create a delightful chaos that fills the air.

    <p>
      As you sip tea from an upside-down teacup and nibble on absurdly shaped pastries, you find yourself immersed in the whimsy of the moment. Conversations veer from the absurd to the philosophical, as you become a part of this wonderfully mad tea party.
