    <h1>The Mysterious Room</h1>
    <p>
      You enter the doorway and find yourself in a small, dimly lit room. The walls are covered in intricate paintings of mystical creatures, and shelves are filled with curious objects. In the center of the room, there's an ornate wooden table with a locked chest on top.
