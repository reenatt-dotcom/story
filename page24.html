    <h1>The Queen's Croquet Ground</h1>
    <p>
      You follow the White Rabbit to the Queen's Croquet Ground, where a game of croquet is in progress. The Queen of Hearts presides over the game, and her flamingo mallets and hedgehog balls add to the surreal nature of the event. The playing field is a chaotic mix of live hedgehogs, flamingos, and painted roses.

      The Queen of Hearts, known for her short temper and love for ordering beheadings, eagerly participates in the game. The players include the Cheshire Cat, the Duchess, and various other Wonderland creatures. The rules are constantly changing, and the Queen's whims determine the outcome of each round.

      As you watch the peculiar game unfold, you can't help but be amused by the absurdity of it all. The Queen's commands echo through the air, and the participants scramble to follow her ever-changing instructions. Flamingos are swung like mallets, hedgehogs are used as balls, and painted roses are the croquet hoops.
