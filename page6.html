    <h1>The Queen's Croquet Ground</h1>
    <p>
      You arrive at the Queen's Croquet Ground, where a game of croquet is in full swing. The grass is vibrant and meticulously manicured, and the playing field is adorned with whimsical obstacles, including flamingos serving as mallets and hedgehogs serving as balls.

      The Queen of Hearts, dressed in her regal attire, presides over the game with a sharp gaze and a quick temper. The air is tense as participants try their best to navigate the peculiarities of croquet in Wonderland, where the rules are ever-changing and the consequences of mistakes can be severe.

      You watch as the Queen issues orders, the Cheshire Cat grins mischievously, and the flamingos gracefully glide through the air. The game becomes a spectacle of chaos and absurdity, but also an opportunity for you to witness the unpredictable nature of Wonderland firsthand.
