    <h1>The Mysterious Room</h1>
    <p>
      As you insert the key into the lock and turn it, the door creaks open, revealing a dimly lit room. You cautiously step inside, and the door slams shut behind you. The room is filled with peculiar objects and a strange ticking sound echoes in the air. In one corner, you notice a small table with a note. Will you read the note or search the room for other clues?
