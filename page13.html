    <h1>The Mad Tea Party</h1>
    <p>
      You stumble upon the Mad Tea Party, a whimsical gathering of eccentric characters engaged in a perpetual tea time. The table is set with mismatched cups and saucers, and the air is filled with nonsensical conversations and bursts of laughter.

    <p>
      The March Hare, the Dormouse, and the Hatter welcome you to join their never-ending tea party. Time seems to have lost its meaning in this peculiar place, as the characters engage in riddles, wordplay, and nonsensical banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You sip on tea that changes flavor with every pour, converse with characters who defy logic, and find yourself caught up in the joyous chaos of the Mad Tea Party. It's an enchanting experience that challenges your understanding of reality and embraces the power of imagination.
