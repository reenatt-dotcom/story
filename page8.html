    <h1>The Queen's Croquet Ground</h1>
    <p>
      You find yourself at the Queen's Croquet Ground, a surreal place filled with oversized playing cards, peculiar rules, and a sense of impending chaos. The Queen of Hearts, a formidable and unpredictable ruler, presides over the croquet game.

      The game is a spectacle like no other, with flamingo mallets, hedgehog balls, and the constant threat of the Queen's explosive temper. The cards scurry about, painting the roses red, and the Cheshire Cat grins mischievously from a nearby tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      You navigate the absurdity of the croquet game, trying to follow the ever-changing rules while avoiding the wrath of the Queen. It's a whimsical and nerve-wracking experience that pushes the boundaries of logic and challenges your ability to adapt.
